# sync-squirrel

## What It Does
This project automates the tedious task of keeping user emails up-to-date across three systems: an email system, a scheduling system, and a CRM.

The Problem: It's time-consuming and soul-crushing to sync emails manually. So, it doesn't get done. As a result, my client's marketing campaigns weren't as successful as they could've been, because they weren't sending targeted emails to many of their users.

The Solution: A background app that continuously checks for any new users and immediately updates the other systems once it finds any.
